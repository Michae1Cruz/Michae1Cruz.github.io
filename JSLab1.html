<!-- Extend the Madlib so that it has at least 8 different words-->
<p> Here's a madlib about a kid named <span id = "name1">____</span>  who had an imaginary friend <span id = "name2"> ____</span>. One day the two of them went up a hill and found a pot of <span id = "noun1"> _____ </span>. Next to it was a pile of <span id = "noun2">____</span>. The very next day they found a new friend named <span id = "name3">_____</span>. Together they both went to buy <span id = "noun3">_____</span>. The store was named after their favorite celebrity <span id = "name4">_____</span>. They went home and along the way saw that their house was filled with <span id = "noun4">_____</span>
